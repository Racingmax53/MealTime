# MealTime
The meal planning and recipe recommendation system is a software application that generates a weekly meal plan with a shopping list and recommended recipes based on the user's dietary restrictions, food preferences, and mealtime availability. The goal is to provide an easy-to-use tool that helps users make healthier food choices and maintain a balanced diet. The objectives include designing a user-friendly web-based interface, implementing a scalable database, and integrating machine learning algorithms to recommend recipes that fit the user's dietary preferences and restrictions. The benefits include simplifying meal planning, promoting healthy eating habits, and providing personalized recommendations that align with the user's goals and preferences. The system will also help users save money by reducing food waste and unnecessary purchases.
